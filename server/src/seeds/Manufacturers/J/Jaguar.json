    "description": "In 1922, a gentleman named William Lyons founded the Swallow Sidecar Company. A few years later, he built his first car, the SS1. Then in 1935, he introduced a breakthrough – the SS Jaguar – and a star was born. His company quickly became famous with the Jaguar line, which were both visually stunning and technically ground-breaking. The C-type, D-Type and E-type models paved the way for the current models. The rest, as they say, is history.",
